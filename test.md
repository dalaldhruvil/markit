Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As John Gruber writes on the Markdown site

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Markit uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.net/) - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to-extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - fast node.js network app framework 
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - duh

And of course Markit itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/strongSoda/editor)
 on GitHub.
